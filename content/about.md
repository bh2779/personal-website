### » Introduction
I am a rising junior at **Columbia University**, where I am majoring in *Computer Science* and minoring in *Applied Math* within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am particularly interested in machine learning and its practical applications, such as in the finance industry and in natural language processing. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, drawing, playing poker, and practicing the clarinet.

### » Experience

This summer, I will be interning at **Wells Fargo** as a Data Engineering Intern on the Wealth Investment Management Technology Team in Charlotte, NC.

During the summer of 2022, I was a Software Engineering Intern at **AT&T** in Dallas, TX, where I worked on the CSO Next-Gen Research & Data Security Team. I built a machine learning pipeline that processes customer service records to detect SIM-swap fraud using NLP. I also led four other interns to build a prototype mobile application that utilizes unsupervised learning to optimize network speeds, which placed 2nd in the company-wide Intern Innovation Challenge and is pending patent approval.
