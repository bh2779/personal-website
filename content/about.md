### » Introduction
I am a junior at **Columbia University**, where I am majoring in *Computer Science* and minoring in *Applied Math* within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am particularly interested in machine learning and its practical applications, such as in the finance industry and in natural language processing. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, drawing, playing poker, playing competitive Pokémon, and practicing the clarinet.

### » Experience

This summer, I interned at **Wells Fargo** as a Software Engineering Intern on the Wealth Investment Management Technology Team in Charlotte, NC. I developed authorization services enabling external clients to access Wells Fargo's internal APIs for money movement, as well as regression tests to identify and rectify bugs in new iterations of code.

During the summer of 2022, I was a Software Engineering Intern at **AT&T** in Dallas, TX, where I worked on the CSO Next-Gen Research & Data Security Team. I built a machine learning pipeline that processes customer service records to detect SIM-swap fraud using NLP. I also led four other interns to build a prototype mobile application that utilizes unsupervised learning to optimize network speeds, which placed 2nd in the company-wide Intern Innovation Challenge and is pending patent approval.
