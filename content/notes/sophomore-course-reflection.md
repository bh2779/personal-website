This is a reflection on the courses I took my sophomore year of college (September 2022 - May 2023) at Columbia, inspired by Joanna Yao's page [here](https://hachiyuki8.github.io/cmu/course-reviews).

## Fall 2022
Like the previous semester, I chose to take six classes in hopes of graduating in 3 years.

#### » Advanced Programming (COMS W3157)
Taught by John Hui
* **Content:** Intro to systems programming taught in C. Provides an intro to UNIX, covering I/O, TCP/IP networking, sockets, and HTTP protocol, which culminates in building a web server in the final assignment. Also covers the basics of version control with Git.
* **Teaching/workload:** I was a little concerned taking this class since Professor Jae Woo Lee, who usually teaches this class, was not teaching it this semester. However, John did a really good job teaching it. Since he is younger (a PhD candidate), I think he was able to relate and connect well with the students and TAs. His lectures were decent, and I found his lecture notes to be very helpful for studying. The class is infamously difficult and I think it generally lives up to this expectation. However, the class is curved well so it isn't too scary. I wish I had taken five classes instead of six so I could've spent more time on this class.
* **Strongly recommend/required:** This is part of the CS core so every CS major must take this class, but I think it is better to take it as soon as possible. Many of the CS electives list this class as a prerequisite, so I would recommend getting this out of the way as soon as possible. The concepts covered in this class are also essential for many fields within CS, so it's good to learn this background knowledge earlier.

#### » Fundamentals of Computer Systems (CSEE W3827)
Taught by Professor Martha Kim
* **Content:** Covers low level stuff like logic gates and assembly language.
* **Teaching/workload:** The lectures were clear and easy to follow, though I personally found the content to be less interesting than my other classes. Problem sets were graded for completion/effort rather than correctness, so the workload was not too bad. The problems themselves were also not that difficult. The problem sets do a good job of reflecting the difficulty level of the midterm and final. There was also a programming assignment in assembly language, which I found to be somewhat time-consuming and difficult.
* **Somewhat recommend/required:** Although this is part of the CS core, it is not really a prerequisite for any of the CS electives aside from the ones that focus on low-level stuff. This means that you could push this class aside to take later. My interests lie in AI/ML and SWE, so I did not find this class to be very interesting. I found coding in MIPS to be complicated and tedious, especially since it is unlikely that I will use it in practice. However, I can appreciate the fact that this class gave me a better understanding of how computers work.

#### » Intro to Databases (COMS W4111)
Taught by Professor Eugene Wu
* **Content:** Relational databases, SQL, query optimization, physical database design
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is pretty good at lecturing and walking through examples. However, I found that the pace of the first half of the semester was a little slow while the pace of the second half of the semester was a little fast. The problem sets were somewhat challenging, as were the midterm and final. We had two projects, which were time-consuming but pretty easy to do well in as long as you followed the requirements. The class is curved, so I was not too concerned about my grade.
* **Highly recommend:** I found a lot of the skills I learned in this class to be desired skills when I interviewed for data science positions. I also had to work with SQL and databases during my Summer 2022 internship and I found that a lot of what I learned in this class would have been helpful for my internship. One of the projects also involves working with Flask and AWS, which are useful skills as well that you typically don't expect to cover in a databases class.

#### » Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH UN2030)
Taught by Professor Konstantin Aleshkin
* **Content:** Solving different types of ordinary differential equations, including linear/nonlinear equations, homogeneous equations, and higher-order equations.
* **Teaching/workload:** Most of the lectures involved prooving the different theorems and formulas that were introduced to us. I found it to be most helpful when the professor walked through example problems. We had weekly problem sets, which were typically on the easier side. The midterms and final were also relatively easy.
* **Recommend**: I took this class for my applied math minor, so I would not recommend this class for everyone or for every CS major. However, the class is well-taught and not too difficult, so I think anyone with an interest in math should take this class.

#### » Principles of Economics (ECON W1105)
Taught by Professor Prajit Dutta
* **Content:** Basically covered AP Macroeconomics and AP Microeconomics.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor does a good job of showing and explaining examples. Workload is pretty light. The problem sets were easy and did not take long to complete. The midterm and final were somewhat difficult, not because each individual problem was hard, but because there was so much content to test on.
* **Required:** This class is required for all engineering students, so I don't have much to say about whether or not I recommend it.

#### » Language, Brain, and Mind (LING UN3103)
Taught by Professor William Foley
* **Content:** Intro to neurolinguistics, covers how different parts of the brain contribute to language processing and production, as well as different views of how the brain learns language. I took this class because I enjoyed Intro to Linguistics the previous semester, though the content this class covered did not have much in common with Intro to Linguistics.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor does a good job of emphasizing key ideas. Even though he covers a lot of material, it is not too overwhelming and you only need to remember key ideas. The workload is very light and grading is pretty lenient.
* **Recommend:** Although I did not enjoy this class as much as Intro to Linguistics, it was nice to have a lighter class in a heavier courseload this semester. I think this is a good option for someone looking to take a more laidback class to fulfill their non-technical elective requirement.

## Spring 2023
I found the previous semester to be too heavy, and I realized that I would rather graduate a semester later (graduate in December 2024) and be able to guarantee good performance in my classes and enjoy my time in college.

#### » Artificial Intelligence (COMS W4107)
Taught by Professor Tony Dear
* **Content:** Covers a wide range of topics within AI, from simpler search algorithms such as DFS and BFS to more advanced concepts such as HMMs and neural networks.
* **Teaching/workload:** Similar to that of Computational Linear Algebra, which I took with him in my freshman spring semester.
* **Highly recommend:** Since AI is such a hot topic nowadays, I think it is good for any CS major to have some understanding of it even if it is not a field they necessarily want to pursue. This class provides a good introduction to it.

#### » Natural Language Processing (COMS W4705)
Taught by Professor Daniel Bauer
* **Content:** Covers both linguistic ideas (such as syntax and semantics) as well as NLP techniques such as Naive Bayes models, HMMs, TF\*IDF, ELMo, and transformers.
* **Teaching/workload:** Like when I had this professor my freshman fall, I found the professor to be a very good lecturer. This professor has a background in linguistics, so I found that he spent more time on linguistic concepts than I preferred. I enjoyed the end of the semester the most, when he introduced cutting-edge technologies such as GPT and BERT. The workload for this class was relatively light since we were given a lot of time to work on each programming assignment.
* **Recommend:** Similar to my explanation for the AI course. However, since NLP is more niche, I would not recommend it as strongly to someone who isn't as interested in the field.

#### » Partial Differential Equations (MATH UN3028)
Taught by Elena Giorgi
* **Content:** Solving three classic examples of PDEs, namely the wave equation, heat equation, and the Laplace equation. Different techniques are introduced, including d'Alembert's formula (I have written the proof for it in the Notes page of this website) and separation of variables. The class also introduces Fourier series.
* **Teaching/workload:** Similar to that of Ordinary Differential Equations, which I took the previous semester.
* **Recommend:** Similar explanation to that of Ordinary Differential Equations.

#### » Chinese Religious Traditions (RELI UN2405)
Taught by Professor Zhaohua Yang
* **Content:** Covers the origins/historic context, beliefs, and practices of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism as well as how they have changed over time.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor does a good job emphasizing important topics and has a good pace in his lectures. The workload was on the lighter side, especially compared to my CS and math classes. The midterm and final were relatively easy, as were the two quizzes.
* **Recommend:** This is a good class to fulfill the Global Core requirement. The content is relatively interesting in my opinion and the class itself is not difficult at all.

#### » General Chemistry Lab (CHEM UN1500)
Taught by Professor Joseph Ulichny
* **Content:** Lectures covered similar content to general chemistry. The concepts covered in lecture were put to practice in the lab, where we used techniques like chromatography and titration.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is nice and a decent lecturer. Workload was heavier than I expected, since we had weekly quizzes as well as a midterm and final in addition to lab work and writing up lab reports (my friends who took physics lab only had to do lab work and write lab reports).
* **Do not recommend:** Unless if you are required to take chemistry lab for your major or strongly prefer chemistry over physics, I would recommend taking physics lab instead.
