This is a reflection on the courses I took my freshman year of college (September 2021 - May 2022) at Columbia, inspired by Joanna Yao's page [here](https://hachiyuki8.github.io/cmu/course-reviews).

## Fall 2021

Since this was my first semester at Columbia and I wasn't sure how difficult the classes would be, I wanted to choose safe classes that I felt confident I could do well in. At the time, I was unsure if I wanted to major in chemical engineering or computer science, so I wanted to take classes that would fulfill requirements for both.

#### » Multivariable Calculus for Engineers and Applied Scientists (APMA E2000)
Taught by Professor Drew Youngren
* **Content:** Pretty standard Calculus III material. I had already learned most of the content in my high school Calculus III class, so it wasn't too difficult to pick up again.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is a nice and funny guy. He was very responsive and flexible when I needed to take the second midterm online because I had COVID. The lectures were pretty well-prepared, so it felt like a thorough review of what I had already learned. The workload was pretty standard, with one problem set per week. There were also weekly online quizzes, which were typically pretty straightforward but I had to make sure to read problems carefully.
* **Required:** This class is required for all engineering students, so I don't have much to say about whether or not I recommend it.


#### » 2nd Term Intensive General Chemistry (CHEM UN1604)
Taught by Professor Ann McDermott
* **Content:** Mostly covered the later topics in general chemistry (think second half of AP Chemistry). This includes thermochemistry, equilibrium, acid-base reactions, kinetics, etc. I had already learned the material before since I had taken AP Chemistry and also competed in the Chemistry Olympiad, so I felt very comfortable with the content.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor was very nice and was pretty good at lecturing. The workload for this class was pretty light. There were recommended homework problems each week, but they were not necessary to complete. Since I was pretty comfortable with most of the content, I skimmed the homework problems and only completed the ones I felt less familiar with. There were also mandatory recitations which had weekly quizzes, which were pretty easy if you didn't have any issues with the homework problems.
* **Recommend:** I recommend taking this class for anyone who did well in AP Chemistry; The grading is pretty lenient and the class is 4 credits instead of 3, so it's good to take advantage of this class.

#### » Intro to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists (ENGI E1006)
Taught by Professor Daniel Bauer
* **Content:** Essentially an intro CS class taught in Python. The class assumes you have no CS background at all, and starts with the most basic ideas in programming such as variables and loops.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is a very good lecturer. He is also pretty responsive to emails, which I really liked. I had him again as a professor during my sophomore year when I took NLP, which I enjoyed. The workload for this class was reasonable. We had several coding assignments none of which were too hard. Instead of a midterm, there are four quizzes throughout the semester, which were also straightforward.
* **Somewhat recommend:** Although I do think this class was helpful for me in terms of building up the confidence I needed to commit as a CS major, I do regret not taking Data Structures instead. Most of this class was a review for me, and I think that if I spent a little bit of time during the summer learning the material, I would not have needed to take the class. Overall, I think the class is great for someone with no CS experience, but anyone with experience in Python should use the time to take another class.

#### » Physics I: Mechanics and Relativity (PHYS UN1601)
Taught by Professor Brian Cole
* **Content:** A lot of the mechanics content is similar to that covered in AP Physics C, though the problems are more difficult than what you'd see in an AP Physics C exam. The relativity content was completely new to me. This class only covers special relativity, including ideas such as length contraction, time-dilation, as well as $e=mc^2$. This class is very math-heavy, specifically in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is a decent lecturer, though he moves very quickly since there is so much content to cover. He prepares a lengthy set of class notes, which I found to be very helpful since I referred back to it a lot when I was working on the problem sets. This class had the heaviest workload out of all of my classes this semester. The problem sets were very time-consuming, so it's good if you have friends in the class that you can work with.
* **Somewhat recommend:** I think this class was a good choice for me personally, since it forced me to develop good study habits that I didn't necessarily need in order to get by in my other classes. However, for someone who is taking other time-consuming classes or isn't confident in their math/physics background, I would not recommend this class.


#### » The Art of Engineering (ENGI E1102)
Taught by Professor David Vallancourt
* **Content:** Unlike traditional lecture-based courses, this class mostly consists of guest speakers discussing their areas of research. The goal of this class is to help students gain a broader idea of engineering and its subfields.
* **Teaching/workload**: Because of how this class is structured, the professor didn't really do much teaching and was more like a host or MC. He was a pretty nice guy though and was very flexible for the final project. Aside from the final project, this class had very little work. The final project was very time-consuming for me, though this was due to the fact that my group was half the size of other groups and I also had COVID, which cost me two weeks of time.
* **Required:** This class is required for all engineering students, so I don't have much to say about whether or not I recommend it.

## Spring 2022
Since I did well in my first semester, I felt comfortable challenging myself more the second semester. After calculating out how many credits I needed to take, I realized it would be possible for me to graduate in three years if I started taking six classes per semester.

#### » Data Structures in Java (COMS W3134)
Taught by Professor Paul Blaer
* **Content:** All of the basics that you would need to know for SWE interviews, such as time/space complexity, data structures (obviously), algorithms for searching and sorting (e.g. binary search, quicksort, Dijkstra, etc.), and recursion.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is a very good lecturer. He's a nice and funny guy, so his lectures are interesting. The workload for this class was pretty standard, with several coding assignments throughout the semester. The midterm and final were also pretty straightforward.
* **STRONGLY Recommend/Required:** Though every CS major will take this class at some point, I strongly recommend taking it as soon as possible. Not only will this allow you to take CS electives sooner, but it is also essential for doing well in itnerviews. I would even recommend this class for non-CS majors who have some interest in CS, since this class covers all of the fundamentals.

#### » Discrete Mathematics (COMS W3203)
Taught by Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi
* **Content:** Pretty much what you'd expect from a discrete class, starting with basic OR/AND stuff and working its way towards probability and proofs.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is very nice, and a decent lecturer. The workload for this class was pretty standard. Homeworks were pretty easy. If you have a background in competition math (AMC), then this class should not be hard.
* **Recommend/Required:** Every CS major will take this class eventually, but I recommend that those interested in AI/ML take this class as early as possible. AI/ML is built upon the ideas of probability and statistics, which this class provides a basic intro to.

#### » Computational Linear Algebra (COMS W3251)
Taught by Professor Tony Dear
* **Content:** Basically just a linear algebra class, but you're allowed to use NumPy.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is great at lecturing, and is also responsive to emails and Edstem posts. I had him again when I took AI, which I enjoyed. Class workload consists of one homework assignment every two weeks. Each assignment typically consists of a theoretical/concept-based part and a coding part. I found the coding parts to be easier. I found the midterm to be pretty difficult and prepared better for the final, so I ended up doing well in the class. The class is also curved well.

#### » University Writing (ENGL CC1010)
Taught by Ji Hyun Joo
* **Content:** Standard writing class. The theme for the section I chose was "Data and Society," so a lot of the readings and videos we watched were related to big data and AI.
* **Teaching/workload:** The instructor was very nice and graded pretty well as long as you listen to her feedback. Workload is the same as all of the other University Writing classes (4 essays).
* **Required:** This class is required for all students, so I don't have much to say about whether or not I recommend it.

#### » Intro to Linguistics (LING UN3101)
Taught by Professor John McWhorter
* **Content:** Covered basics of linguistics, including phonology, morphology, syntax, evolution of language, etc. I didn't have any background in linguistics before taking this class and I found the content to be pretty interesting and beginner-friendly.
* **Teaching/workload:** The professor is an excellent lecturer. He is very good at explaining concepts and providing examples and is also very fun. The workload was on the lighter side. The problem sets weren't too difficult, and the midterm and final were both pretty reasonable in terms of difficulty.
* **Highly recommend:** I had heard good things about this class that led me to register for it, and it surpassed my expectations. I think it is one of the best classes to take to fulfill the non-technical requirement for the engineering core.

#### » Physics II: Thermodynamics/Electricity
Taught by Professor Brian Cole
* **Content:** Mostly focused on electricity and magnetism. I don't remember the class covering thermodynamics at all. The first half of the class (before magnetism was introduced) was relatively easy. The second half was more difficult since it brought back concepts from relativity that I was rusty in.
* **Teaching/workload:** Similar to Physics I.
* **Somewhat recommend:** Same as Physics I.
